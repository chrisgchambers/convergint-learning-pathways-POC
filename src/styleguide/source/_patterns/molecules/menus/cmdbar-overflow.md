order: 99

To make the pivot bar responsive please checkout the overflow enabled version of this [pivot bar](?p=molecules-pivotbar-overflow).

### Accessibility:

* ```role="menubar"``` .... gives the user a clear indication on how many buttons are in the current menu
* ```aria-hidden``` ....... items that are hidden also have beside the CSS class `.is-overflow-item` the aria-hidden attribute set

***Currently the overflow shown here is only static***

Command bar use different variants of the command buttom, for example the first button has defined a drop down. The second buttom has no drop down defined. In this case the chevron won't show up.
